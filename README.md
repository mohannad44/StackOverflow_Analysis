# StackOverflow Analysis
This analysis is written for Udacity project 4 (write a blog). The notebook includid will be used to get some insights into StackOverflow 2019 survey data

The purpose of this analysis is to know if users without IT majors satisfied with their careers or did the trends just forced them to stay relative and learn how to program? I relized at the end that it is not really a great analysis to be performed in this dataset but I tried to get something.

* Which languages are preferred by users without an IT major?
* Does not having IT major effect their career satisfaction?
* Do users without IT major code because of their jobs or because is it their hobby?
